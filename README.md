9/10

##### Comments:
Very challenging, but the most fun because I was enthused to learn about React. I was in new territory and loved every bit of it. Now that I know how to navigate it, I wanna get good at manipulating my way through it so I can create some really cool stuff. Note to self: *You did it. You persisted, kiddo. Keep chugging!*.

##### Skills acquired:
* React.js
* Node.js
* npm
* API intergration
* The use of the terminal
